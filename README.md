# NYSL-website

TASK: Develop a website for the soccer teams of The Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL).

informative multi-page website based on the client's requirements.

PROCESS:

• Testing that the web pages work as specified, on multiple browsers.

CHALLENGE: 
• Working with different numbered and pointed lists.
• Creating forms with checkboxes and radiobuttons
• Get them all organised and nicely styled. 

WHAT I LIKED MOST: • Playing around with CSS was fun. 
• The realisation arises that I'm able to transform my ideas and designs into a product.
